# Ethereum Web3 API Integration for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Applications

This project leverages the Ethereum Web3 API to create a user-centric interface that seamlessly connects with prominent DeFi protocols on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can perform various financial transactions directly through their Metamask wallets, eliminating the need for centralized platforms.

## Project Features

* **Kyber Network Integration:**
    * Fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices denominated in ETH.
    * Offers an intuitive interface for effortless "token swaps" with minimal user clicks.
* **MetaMask-less Ethereum-Based Transfers:**
    * nables direct transfers of Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies Metamask wallets to any wallets compatible with the Ethereum blockchain.
    * Utilizes Kyber Network's infrastructure for secure and efficient token transfers.
* **MakerDAO Integration for DAI Borrowing:**
    * Connects to the MakerDAO protocol, a decentralized stablecoin platform.
    * Allows users to borrow Dai, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin, based on their collateralized Ethereum holdings.
